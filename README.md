## 🔧 Technical Overview

This is the **IPv6 tunnel connector (slave)** that runs on servers with IPv6 subnets configured. It's part of a distributed proxy architecture for SMM operations.

### Architecture Components

**Complete System Requires:**

1. **Master Proxy Server** ([smm-panel-proxy-master](https://github.com/heysmmprovider/smm-panel-proxy-master))
   - Accepts proxy connections from users
   - Manages slave connections
   - Routes traffic through appropriate slaves

2. **This Repository (Slave Connector)**
   - Runs on IPv6-enabled servers
   - Connects to master via WebSocket
   - Routes traffic through specific IPv6 addresses
   - Handles actual IPv6 traffic tunneling

### How It Works

1. **This connector** runs on your IPv6 server with subnets configured
2. **Connects** to master proxy server via WebSocket (port 3000)
3. **Receives** routing requests with specific IPv6 addresses to use
4. **Routes** the traffic through the requested IPv6 address
5. **Returns** responses back through the tunnel to the master

⚠️ **Important**: This is the SLAVE component. Users don't connect directly to this - they connect to the master proxy server.

**Need the complete setup?** Contact [HeySMMReseller.com](https://heysmmreseller.com) for pre-configured servers with both components installed!

### Key Features:
- 🔄 **Dynamic IPv6 Selection** - Rotate IPs for each SMM service request
- 🚀 **High Performance** - Handle thousands of SMM API requests
- 🔐 **Secure Authentication** - Protect your SMM panel operations
- 📊 **WebSocket Architecture** - Real-time communication for instant SMM delivery
- 🌐 **HTTP/HTTPS Support** - Compatible with all SMM platforms

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- ✅ Server with IPv6 subnets configured
- ✅ Node.js 14+ installed
- ✅ Master proxy server running ([get it here](https://github.com/heysmmprovider/smm-panel-proxy-master))

### Recommended: Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository on your IPv6 server
git clone https://github.com/heysmmprovider/smm-panel-ipv6-proxy.git
cd smm-panel-ipv6-proxy

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure your master proxy server
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set PROXY_SERVER=ws://your-master-proxy:3000

# Start the connector
npm start
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Configure IPv6 Subnets on Your Server

```bash
# Add IPv6 subnets to your network interface
sudo ip -6 addr add 2a13:3380::2/29 dev eno2
sudo ip -6 route add default via 2a13:3380::1 dev eno2

sudo ip -6 addr add 2a0f:dfc0::2/29 dev eno2
sudo ip -6 route add default via 2a0f:dfc0::1 dev eno2

sudo ip -6 addr add 2a0f:a00::2/29 dev eno2
sudo ip -6 route add default via 2a0f:a00::1 dev eno2
```

### Step 2: Deploy the Slave Connector

```bash
# Clone and install manually (recommended)
git clone https://github.com/heysmmprovider/smm-panel-ipv6-proxy.git
cd smm-panel-ipv6-proxy
npm install

# Configure and run
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your master proxy details
npm start
```

### Step 3: Verify Connection

The connector will automatically:
- Connect to your master proxy server
- Report available IPv6 addresses
- Start routing traffic through specified IPs

### Step 4: Users Connect to Master Proxy

Users should connect to the **master proxy server** (not this connector):

```javascript
// Users connect to master proxy, specifying which IPv6 to use
const proxyUrl = 'http://username:2a13:3380:0:0:0:1@master-proxy:8080';

// The master proxy routes through this connector using the specified IPv6
```

## ⚠️ Docker Support (Not Yet Available)

### 🐳 Docker Status: UNTESTED - LIKELY NOT WORKING

**Important Notice:** While Docker images are automatically deployed to Docker Hub during our CI/CD process, **the Docker functionality has NOT been tested and is probably not working correctly**. 

We strongly recommend **NOT using Docker** for deployment at this time. Please use the manual installation method described above instead.

### Why Docker Isn't Ready:
- ❌ Docker configuration has not been tested
- ❌ Network host mode may have issues with IPv6 routing
- ❌ Environment variable handling is unverified
- ❌ The automatic Docker Hub deployment is part of CI/CD but doesn't mean it's functional

### Docker Hub Information:
- **Docker Hub:** [https://hub.docker.com/r/heysmmprovider/smm-panel-ipv6-proxy](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/heysmmprovider/smm-panel-ipv6-proxy)
- **Status:** Images are published automatically but NOT TESTED
- **Recommendation:** DO NOT USE until testing is complete

### If You Want to Try Docker (At Your Own Risk):
```bash
# THIS IS PROBABLY NOT WORKING - NOT RECOMMENDED
# Only shown for reference - use manual installation instead!

docker pull heysmmprovider/smm-panel-ipv6-proxy

docker run -d \
  --name ipv6-connector \
  --network host \
  -e PROXY_SERVER=ws://your-master-proxy:3000 \
  heysmmprovider/smm-panel-ipv6-proxy
```

**⚠️ We will update this README once Docker support has been properly tested and verified. Until then, please use the manual installation method for reliable deployment.**
